Problem Statement + Motivation:

Current routing protocols for LLNs have too high overhead of control traffic to be
effective in small, realistic topologies (1-3 hops) and do not properly account
for the duty-cycled nature of these nodes. 


- control traffic should scale w/ size of network
    - 1-hop should not need any control traffic
    - 2-hop, 3-hop maybe a little more
- control traffic should quiesce as the network goes to steady state
    - shouldn't need to continue to send lots of control msgs to maintain network
    - let the network traffic inform you

- to maintain 1-3 hop topo + increase reliability of network, want to support multiple border routers
    - Do BRs advertise different prefixes, or same prefix? 
    - Do we need external routing table?
    - Do motes have multiple interfaces for different prefixes?

- want motes to learn the duty-cycle schedules of their neighbors, and base
  routing decisions on mains-/battery-powered nature of neighbors



Prior Work
- RPL, Jonathan Hui's Thesis, IP is Dead, other stuff

Estimate of Results and Deliverables:

Design + implementation of IPv6 routing protocol for duty-cycled motes working in 1-3 hops.
- design goals from above
Initial exploration of multiple border router solution.
Evaluation of control msgs overhead, msg latency, packet reception ratios, energy consumption of motes in both RPL and new protocol.
