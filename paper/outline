Paper wants to accomplish several things:

- Motivation starts off by saying: look, for the very common case of indoor, low-power
  sensor networks, there is a need for routing.
- This particular case of WSN topology formation is defined by the following characteristics:
    - mains power available at some locations throughout a space: wall plugs here and there
    - It is feasible to cover the monitored space in a mesh with hops no greater than 3
    - environment can change: furniture, people -- transient connectivity
- explain "state of the art" RPL and why it is insufficient
    - part of this is problems with the complicated ipv6 neighbor discovery
- establish the goals and parameters of our proposed routing protocol
- establish the measurement apparatus for these:
    - TinyOS Kernel
    - Syscalls in Lua
        - challenges developing syscalls
    - Dynamic code loading in Lua
    - fitting everything into the mote
    - "WAX stack"
        - follow similar structure to the sensys paper
        - the components of a network experiment code
        - how to we do logging, where it goes
- build up the comparison between the two:
    - what are the dimensions that matter?
    - which ones can we measure?
        - what are limitations preventing us from measuring the rest?
        - lack of a good MAC layer that has code
- look at control traffic overhead:
    - why does this matter
