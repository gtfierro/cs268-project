Want to evaluate the code dissemination part

Describe the methodology:
- what are the aspects of routing protocol we find important, i.e. what are our goals
- given these goals, what do we need to evaluate to demonstrate whether or not we achieved them
- probably want to write the RPL/ipv6 nd discussion first
